# Turkcell AI Vision Challenge Contest Project

Turkcell AI Vision Challenge competition was held in my company internally and I won the prize with my winning project.Out of 120 project, it is awarded as 1st. 

I created a CNN deep learning algorithm using Pytorch library and pre-trained Resnet-18 model with transfer learning approach. Main target was classifying images correctly.
There were data of 7 different kind of fruits and data is knowingly mixed with false images.
